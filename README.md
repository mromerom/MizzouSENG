#CS 4320 Exercise 2 Group 3

This project is meant to show different graphs related to the 2016 presidential election.

To create this project we used jQuery (http://jquery.com), JavaScript (https://www.javascript.com), and the Huffington Post Pollster API (http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/api).

mjrqq3: I added a graph to show the status of the 2016 Presidential Race between Hillary Clinton and Donal Trump.
